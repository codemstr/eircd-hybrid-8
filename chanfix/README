!!!!!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!!!!!

This version of OpenChanfix works in a hybrid 7.0 server, but ONLY if
you REMOVE the following line from src/s_serv.c:

  { "UID",   CAP_UID },

If you do not remove this line, OpenChanfix will crash if you link it
to another hybrid 7.0 server.

!!!!!! NO LONGER VERY IMPORTANT !!!!!!!
