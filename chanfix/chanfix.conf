# chanfix main config file
# store this in $ircd_install_dir/chanfix/ .

# File format:

# Don't use lines of more than 255 characters.

# Lines consisting of only 0 or more whitespace are ignored.

# Lines beginning with a # are ignored.

# All lines between a line starting with "#/*" and a line starting with
# with "#*/" are ignored (multi-line comment).

# Lines beginning with "i:", "b:" or "s:" are special. See below.

# For all other lines, the syntax is either
# "single_word one or more words" or
# "single_word = one or more words". The single word will be seen as the
# name of the setting, and the rest of the line (except for an equal sign,
# if present) the value of the setting. Any spaces before and after the
# equal sign are removed.

# The config file reader will automatically choose a proper data type to
# store the settings. It does that in the following way:
# If the value is "on", "off" (both case insensitive and without quotes), 
# 1, or 0, the type will be a boolean.
# If the value consists of only numbers, and is not equal to 0 or 1, the
# type will be an integer.
# Otherwise, the type will be a string.

# "i:", "b:" or "s:" can be forced to set the type of a setting to int,
# bool or string, respectively.

# If you want a string setting with value "on", you will have to force it
# to be a string. This can be done by starting the line with "s:", followed
# by zero or more whitespace, then the setting name, and then "on".
# Example: "s: record_message on"
