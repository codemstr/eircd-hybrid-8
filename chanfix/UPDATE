Notes on updating in general:

To prevent confusion of the OCF client, it's best to restart the ircd
when upgrading to a newer version of OCF. While /MODUNLOAD followed by
/MODLOAD should work, it can result in weird behaviour of the OCF client.
The reason for this is that the code which deals with the OCF client is
not extremely robust. Fixing this is one of the largest issues on the 
TODO list.

Notes on updating to the Greyhound releas (2.1.0):

The format of the userfile has changed slightly. No need for any manual
changes; OCF will load the old datafile fine, and when saving, save it
in the new format.

There are 2 new settings: f_flags_per_server and b_flags_per_server. They
denote how many accounts there can be with the same main server and these
two flags. Setting these settings to 0 means there is no limit.

Notes on updating to the Snatched Spanner release (2.0.6):

There is a new configuration file, ignores.conf, which determines which
user@host/server gets ignored. Store that with chanfix.conf. Also, add the
setting 'ignorefile' to chanfix.conf. See example config file for
explanation

Notes on updating to the Banana Bread release (2.0.4):

There is a new property of chanfix users: the "server" property. See the
example users.conf to see how it works. Older config files do not allow
logins anymore because they don't contain the "server" property in users.

If you are updating from an older (2.0.0-2.0.3) version to the Banana Bread
release, you MUST delete all files in the database dir.

This is the last change in the database format for now. We promise that
if we change the database format again, we will create a converter to
update your database to the latest format.

Yet again our apologies for the inconvenience.

Beige & Garion.
